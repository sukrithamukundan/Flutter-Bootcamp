# Startup Namer - Part 1

**What you'll learn**

- How to write a Flutter app that looks natural on iOS, Android, and the web
- The basic structure of a Flutter app
- Finding and using packages to extend the functionality
- Using hot reload for a quicker development cycle

**What you'll build**

You'll implement a simple app that generates proposed names for a startup company. The user can select and unselect names, saving the best ones. The code lazily generates 10 names at a time. As the user scrolls, more names are generated. There is no limit to how far a user can scroll.

The following animated GIF shows how the app works at the completion of part 1&2:
