# Startup Namer - Part 3


## What you'll learn
- How to add interactivity to a stateful widget


## What you'll build 
End users can select and unselect names, saving the best ones.

The following image shows how the app would look like after completing part 3.

In this step, you'll add heart icons to each row. 

- **Step 1:-** Add a `_saved` `Set` to `_RandomWordsState`. This `Set` stores the word pairings that the user favorited. `Set` is preferred to `List` because a properly implemented `Set` doesn't allow duplicate entries.

```
class _RandomWordsState extends State<RandomWords> {
  final _suggestions = <WordPair>[];
  final _saved = <WordPair>{};     // NEW
  final _biggerFont = TextStyle(fontSize: 18.0);
  ...
}
```


- **Step 2:-**
 In the `_buildRow` function, add an `alreadySaved` check to ensure that a word pairing has not already been added to favorites.

```
Widget _buildRow(WordPair pair) {
  final alreadySaved = _saved.contains(pair);  // NEW
  ...
}
```


In `_buildRow()` , you'll also add heart-shaped [icons](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Icon-class.html) to the [`ListTile`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ListTile-class.html) objects to enable favoriting. In the next step, you'll add the ability to interact with the heart icons.

- **Step 3:-** Add the icons after the text, as shown below:

```
Widget _buildRow(WordPair pair) {
  final alreadySaved = _saved.contains(pair);
  return ListTile(
    title: Text(
      pair.asPascalCase,
      style: _biggerFont,
    ),
    trailing: Icon(   // NEW from here... 
      alreadySaved ? Icons.favorite : Icons.favorite_border,
      color: alreadySaved ? Colors.red : null,
    ),                // ... to here.
  );
}
```


- **Step 4:-** Hot reload the app.

You should now see open hearts on each row, but they are not yet interactive.

In the next step, you'll make the heart icons tappable. When the user taps an entry in the list, toggling its favorited state, that word pairing is added or removed from a set of saved favorites.


To do that, you'll modify the `_buildRow` function. If a word entry has already been added to favorites, tapping it again removes it from favorites. When a tile has been tapped, the function calls `setState()` to notify the framework that state has changed.


- **Step 5:-** Add `onTap` to the `_buildRow` method, as shown below:

```
Widget _buildRow(WordPair pair) {
  final alreadySaved = _saved.contains(pair);
  return ListTile(
    title: Text(
      pair.asPascalCase,
      style: _biggerFont,
    ),
    trailing: Icon(
      alreadySaved ? Icons.favorite : Icons.favorite_border,
      color: alreadySaved ? Colors.red : null,
    ),
    onTap: () {      // NEW lines from here...
      setState(() {
        if (alreadySaved) {
          _saved.remove(pair);
        } else { 
          _saved.add(pair); 
        } 
      });
    },               // ... to here.
  );
}
```


> Tip: In Flutter's reactive style framework, calling **setState()** triggers a call to the **build()** method for the **State** object, resulting in an update to the UI.


- **Step 6:-** Hot reload the app.

You should be able to tap any tile to favorite or unfavorite the entry. Tapping a tile generates an implicit ink splash animation emanating from the tap point.

## Observations

> - [Trailing](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ListTile/trailing.html) is a widget to display after the title(right-aligned). Typically an Icon Widget.
> - Leading is a widget to display before the title(left-aligned). Typically an Icon Widget.
> - **setState()** When the widgetâ€™s state changes, the state object calls setState(), telling the framework to redraw the widget.


## Challenge

You've already seen how a simple package such as the English words package works, and how it gets downloaded and incorporated into our project. You're now ready to go ahead and  **incorporate an audio file playing package** into our project.
 
The Challenge for today is to incorporate **Button click sound effect when tapping the heart icon.**
 
**Hint:**

1. Download the sound(https://www.zapsplat.com/sound-effect-category/button-clicks/)

2. Store it in the assets folder

3. Find a suitable package from pub.dev (https://pub.dev/packages/audioplayers you can use this package)

4. Add dependency in your pubspec.yaml file

5. Import and use it in your project.
